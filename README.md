# Listing-Template2
html/css template for ebay listings

##Grrrr... So this is my second attempt.  
My [first one](https://github.com/colost8rams/Listing-Template) looks great and functions well.  ***PROBLEM IS*** the JQuery scripts get blocked and it seens to do funny things with bootstrap. 

So, I am going to try and do it bare bones.  Now I am starting to understand why all of the larger more commercial listers build layout the old-fashioned way with tables....
